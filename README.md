# decl-cm-playground

AKA: Declarative configuration management playground.

## Idea

[Declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) has several
definitions which are not entirely compatible with each other. This leads to
people describing a variety of systems as declarative in one sense, but not in
other senses.

This repository will explore this in the context of configuration management
(CM) as the approach used by these software systems can vary greatly. In
particular, some CM systems allow for conditionals, loops, and ordering of
tasks. While these constructs are useful, depending on their implementation,
they can make the CM system less declarative.
